    counting the number of rows. Make sure it matches.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
dat1 <- read.csv("C:/Users/Hope/Documents/PM566HW/chs_individual.txt")
dim(dat1)
```

    ## [1] 1200   23

``` r

dim(dat2)
```

    ## [1] 12 27

``` r

  x = dat1, y = dat2, by.x = "townname", by.y = "townname", all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE
) 

# take a look at data after merging

``` r
# dealing with NAs
dat <- as.data.table(dat)

dat[, bmi := fcoalesce(bmi, mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)),
    by = .(male, hispanic)]

dat[, fev := fcoalesce(fev, mean(fev, na.rm = TRUE)),
    by = .(male, hispanic)]
```

  - There are 1200 rows and 49 columns in dat with some missing values.

<!-- end list -->

2.  Create a new categorical variable named “obesity\_level” using the
    BMI measurement (underweight BMI\<14; normal BMI 14-22; overweight
    BMI 22-24; obese BMI\>24). To make sure the variable is rightly
    coded, create a summary table that contains the minimum BMI, maximum
    BMI, and the total number of observations per category.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# create variable
dat[bmi<14, obesity_level := "underweight"]
dat[bmi>=14 & bmi<22, obesity_level := "normal"]
dat[bmi>=22 & bmi<24, obesity_level := "overweight"]
dat[bmi>24, obesity_level := "obese"]

# summary table of obesity level
n <- count(dat, obesity_level)

merge(n, dat[, .(
  bmi_min = min(bmi, na.rm = TRUE),
  bmi_max = max(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
),
by = obesity_level])
```

    ##    obesity_level   n  bmi_min  bmi_max
    ## 1:        normal 975 14.00380 21.96387
    ## 2:         obese 103 24.00647 41.26613
    ## 3:    overweight  87 22.02353 23.99650
    ## 4:   underweight  35 11.29640 13.98601

  - The obesity\_level is coded successfully.

<!-- end list -->

3.  Create another categorical variable named “smoke\_gas\_exposure”
    that summarizes “Second Hand Smoke” and “Gas Stove.” The variable
    should have four categories in total.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# create variable
dat[smoke == 0 & gasstove == 0, smoke_gas_exposure := "none_exposed"]
dat[smoke == 0 & gasstove == 1, smoke_gas_exposure := "gas_exposed"]
dat[smoke == 1 & gasstove == 0, smoke_gas_exposure := "smoke_exposed"]
dat[smoke == 1 & gasstove == 1, smoke_gas_exposure := "all_exposed"]

# dropping NAs
# dat <- dat[!is.na(smoke_gas_exposure)]

# summary table of smoke_gas_exposure
count(dat, smoke_gas_exposure)
```

    ##    smoke_gas_exposure   n
    ## 1:        all_exposed 151
    ## 2:        gas_exposed 739
    ## 3:       none_exposed 214
    ## 4:      smoke_exposed  36
    ## 5:               <NA>  60

  - The smoke\_gas\_exposure variable has 4 categories which reflects
    the exposure degree to smoke and gas.

<!-- end list -->

4.  Create four summary tables showing the average (or proportion, if
    binary) and sd of “Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ml)” and
    asthma indicator by town, sex, obesity level, and
    “smoke\_gas\_exposure.”

<!-- end list -->

``` r

## EDA

The primary questions: - What is the association between BMI and FEV? -
What is the association between smoke and gas exposure and FEV? - What
is the association between PM2.5 exposure and FEV?

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

1.  Facet plot showing scatterplots with regression lines of BMI vs FEV
    by “townname”.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
ggplot(data = dat, 
       mapping = aes(x = bmi, y = fev, color = townname))+
  geom_point()+
  stat_smooth(method = lm)+
  facet_wrap(~townname, nrow = 4)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

2.  Stacked histograms of FEV by BMI category and FEV by smoke/gas
    exposure. Use different color schemes than the ggplot default.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
ggplot(dat, mapping = aes(x = fev, color = obesity_level, fill = obesity_level))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50, alpha = 0.7,position="identity")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuOr")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Purples")
```

![](HW2_files/figure-gfm/histogram-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
dat %>%
  filter(!(smoke_gas_exposure %in% NA)) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = fev, color = smoke_gas_exposure, fill = smoke_gas_exposure))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 50, position="identity")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuOr")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Purples")
```

![](HW2_files/figure-gfm/histogram-2.png)<!-- -->

3.  Barchart of BMI by smoke/gas exposure.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
dat %>%
  filter(!(smoke_gas_exposure %in% NA)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = obesity_level, color = smoke_gas_exposure, fill = smoke_gas_exposure))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Purples")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Purples")
```

![](HW2_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

4.  Statistical summary graphs of FEV by BMI and FEV by smoke/gas
    exposure category.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
dat %>%
  filter(!(obesity_level %in% NA)) %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = obesity_level, y = fev))+
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_sdl")

```

![](HW2_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png)<!-- -->

5.  A leaflet map showing the concentrations of PM2.5 mass in each of
    the CHS communities.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(leaflet)

pm25.pal = colorNumeric(c("blue", "purple", "red"), domain = dat$pm25_mass)

leaflet(dat) %>%
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap") %>%
  addCircles(lat = ~lat, lng = ~lon, opacity = 1, fillOpacity = 1, radius = 500, color = ~pm25.pal(pm25_mass)) %>%
  addLegend(position = "bottomleft", pal = pm25.pal, values = dat$pm25_mass , title = "PM2.5 mass concentrations", opacity = 1)
